In all interactions and commit messages, be extremely concise and sacrifice
grammar for the sake of brevity.

## PR Comments

<pr-comment-rule>
When I say to add a comment to a PR with a TODO on it use a 'checkbox' markdown
format to add the TODO. For instance:

<example>
- [ ] A description of the TODO goes here
</example>
</pr-comment-rule>

## GitHub

Your primary method for interacting with GitHub is through the GitHub CLI.

## Git

When creating branches, prefix them with deshiknaves/ to indicate that they came
from me.

## Plans

At the end of each plan, give ma list of unresolved questions to answer, if any.
Make the questions extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of
concision. Always end the plan with a question.
